This table is intended to provide municipalities, residences, businesses, and application developers with a comprehensive set of standardized addresses for the City of Charlottesville.
- Special User Permit Area (186 Records): https://opendata.charlottesville.org/datasets/special-use-permit-area
A special use permit allows a landowner to obtain a tract of land for a use that does not fall directly under the permitted usage for that specifically zoned area. In most areas, the community is separated into different zones determined by the community’s zoning commission. These zones are then given a specific set of “by-right” permitted uses. This means that any land within that zone can be used for the permitted usage only, by right of the owner. In addition to the regular usages, under the local zoning regulations, each zone is usually given a “special uses” section allowing for uses that are just outside the intended uses for that zone.
